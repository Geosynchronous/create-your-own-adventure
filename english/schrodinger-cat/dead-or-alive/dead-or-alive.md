You opened the box so you're alive.

However the cat with you is dead.

He wasn't quite so lucky.

Or maybe, luck has nothing to do with it.

The universe with teaming with fluctuating energetic potentials.

Perhaps a "dead" cat exist in another universe.

Something we can know nothing about, just like information disapperaing beyond the event horizon of a black hole.
