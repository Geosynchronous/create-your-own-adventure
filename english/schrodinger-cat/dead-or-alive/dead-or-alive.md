You opened the box so you're alive.

However the cat with you is dead.

He wasn't quite so lucky.

The universe is teaming with energetic quantum fluctuations.
One might wonder, if the bifurcated potential of being alive or dead portents that many worlds do indeed exist.
If so maybe, it isn't just a mystical question of life after death, but instead another concurrent world of existance that is transcended.  Sort of like what happens when information goes through a black hole.  So maybe luck is not the issue for the "ded" cat, except that a whole new realm of existance is accessed.
